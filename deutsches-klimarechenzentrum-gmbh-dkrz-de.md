                                        <p>Motivated by feedback from CMIP5, the ESGF data federation is emphasizing network connectivity between key ESGF data nodes at DKRZ, CEDA, and AIMS. DKRZ operates together with AIMS and CEDA as the core data archive for the CMIP5 data federation. The data scale for such an archive ranges from several to many terabytes. This replication is also required to be fast and secure. </p>
                                        <p>DKRZ staff started this project by creating a clear picture of the current network topology including hops and bandwidths between sites. Second, they documented and gathered metrics about the network speeds and data transfer speeds. After identification of bottlenecks and adaptation of transfer parameters (server configurations, etc.) and routing paths, the data transfers between DKRZ and AIMS and between DKRZ and CEDA could be increased to considerably more than 1 Gbps, with peak rates above 3 Gbps.  DKRZ is connected to their national research network with a cumulative 7Gbps link. Network tests with the Australian partner, NCI, have not yet been successful.</p>
                                        <p>In the next few months network bandwidth rates should be stabilized and increased in the direction of 10 Gbps, providing the nominal bandwidth is sufficient. In addition, data transfers to and from Australia will be integrated in the tests. In conclusion, the end-to-end data transfer from one ESGF data node to another ESGF data node should be tackled with respect to the ESGF CMIP5 data replication use case.</p>
