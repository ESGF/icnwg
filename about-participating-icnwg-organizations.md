                                        <p>Over the past two decades, the <a href="https://www.llnl.gov">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL)</a> <a href="http://aims.llnl.gov/mission.html">Analytics, Informatics, and Management Systems (AIMS)</a> project has enabled the scientific climate community to self-organize and build an information infrastructure that has revolutionized how climate modeling and intercomparison are performed. The AIMS program leads collaborations to develop an uncertainty quantification diagnostic test bed and data infrastructure for the DOE Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy (ACME) project. Moreover, by working with many others in a global setting, the team is resolving many of the technical challenges regarding scaling and federation (e.g., authentication, sharing, location of data and processing resources, interface standards, etc.) issues that face any attempted large-scale information system. This has been accomplished by using an open systems approach that leverages the efforts of a global community. The technical motivation for this program is based on the success of the <a href="http://esgf.org">Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)</a> and the <a href="http://uvcdat.llnl.gov">Ultra-scale Visualization Climate Data Analysis Tools (UV-CDAT)</a>.</p>

As a national service provider, DKRZ operates a supercomputer center to enable climate simulation and provides the scientific users with the technical infrastructure needed for the processing and analysis of climate data. This also includes support for related application software, and advice and support in data processing issues. Finally, DKRZ also participates in national and international joint projects with the aim of improving the infrastructure for climate modeling. DKRZ thus constitutes an outstanding research infrastructure for model-based simulations of global climate change and its regional effects. This mission is consistent with the new High-Tech Strategy for climate protection as presented by Prof. Dr. Annette Schavan, Federal Minister for Education and Research, at the second Climate Research Summit in Berlin in October 2007.</p>

The Climate4impact portal, built on the firm ESGF foundation, is the result of a collaborative effort within the European FP-7 project <a href="http://www.climate4impact.eu">IS-ENES</a> ; an effort directed to Bridging Climate Research Data and the Needs of the Impact Community (climate change impact modellers, impact and adaptation consultants, as well as other experts using climate change data).
                                            The portal provides data transformation tooling for tailoring data and mapping &amp; plotting capabilities. Also guidance on how to use climate scenarios, documentation on the climate system and examples in several impact and adaptation themes are presented and described, along with the steps required to go from GCM data to impact model input data.
