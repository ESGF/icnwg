                                        <p>-Recap from Workshop on Climate Science (<a href="http://meetings.internet2.edu/2014-cc-climate/">http://meetings.internet2.edu/2014-cc-climate/</a>)</p>
                                        <ul>  Workshop goal: resolving issues that may exist within climate community that can be solved by computer science, networks, data managers, etc.</ul>
                                        <ul>
                                            ICNWG meeting read out: 
                                            <ul>  The meeting was well attended</ul>
                                            <ul>  We need to strongly refocus efforts on data replication use case</ul>
                                            <ul>  GFDL (talked with Balaji), NOAA and NCAR (talked with Anke) expressed interest in joining the working group</ul>
                                            <ul>  A report from this past year noted a lot people experienced performance problems with downloads of CMIP data </ul>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>We are working with 2 use cases of data transfers WRT to ESGF:<br>
                                            • replication case and performance improvement between ESGF sites<br>
                                            • end user downloads to their sites for research
                                        </p>
                                        <p>-Website update (<a href="http://icnwg.llnl.gov">http://icnwg.llnl.gov</a>):</p>
                                        <ul>  Dean is working to place the ICNWG under a .org address to open up the effort of the working group. </ul>
                                        <ul>  pS mesh is now embedded on the site</ul>
                                        <ul>  we need to have better supporting text for each testing direction (to/from which hosts)</ul>
                                        <ul>  We will be adding a new map with relevant logos for front page (this will replace the current map) </ul>
                                        <ul>  Please note the site is now public. To edit content, you will need to log in with your username/password</ul>
                                        <ul>  Mary is working on pulling together an "About" page for the participating sites and organizations. We will need to be request additional "a bouts" from the PIs.</ul>
                                        <p>-6 mo. site reports</p>
                                        <ul>  Mary will send out a boiler plate for each site's section by Tuesday (22 July)</ul>
                                        <ul>  Deadline to get the information from each site is Monday, 4 August</ul>
                                        <ul>
                                            Site reports will roughly include information answering: 
                                            <ul>  -What has been accomplished at the site?</ul>
                                            <ul>  -Is the site on track?</ul>
                                            <ul>  -If not, what still needs to be done?</ul>
                                            <ul>  -What are the action items for the next 6 mo.?</ul>
                                            <ul>  -What were the challenges up to this point?</ul>
                                            <ul>  -Any challenges looking forward?</ul>
                                            <ul>  And a recent diagram showing performance tests between sites.</ul>
                                        </ul>
                                        <ul>  Dean will look into publishing a version of the text via EOS journal</ul>

                                        <ul>  March 2014: pS boxes were supposed to be up--not all of them are up yet so we need to get to this.</ul>

                                        <p>4Gb connections in by August/September<br>
