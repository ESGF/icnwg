                                        <p><em>Overview</em></p>
                                        <p>Over the last year, Dean Williams and Eli Dart formed the ICNWG under ESGF (see diagram at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/about-participating-icnwg-organizations">esgf.github.io/icnwg/about-participating-icnwg-organizations</a> showing the overlapping institutions and support for the working group). Additionally supported by EYR-Global, this working group creates a forum to support the proposed EYR-Global project and international sites as they troubleshoot performance between the ESGF nodes. In addition, the working group created a website  to make the working group’s progress transparent to all participants.  </p>
                                        <p>When starting this project, data transfer performance was variable between all sites, between 10KB/sec and 40MB/sec.  In many cases, the software used to transfer the data is wget or similar http-based tools.  ICNWG aims to transition the collaboration to GridFTP for data replication, driven either by data replication scripts built by data center administrators, or by Globus.   The data set to be used for testing replication performance has not been identified, but there are a wide variety of data sets to choose from.  The data sets chosen will be similar to common climate data sets so that the tests provide a realistic approximation of production data replication performance.</p>
                                        <p>In general, local network, server, and storage infrastructures must be upgraded to accommodate the data transfer performance required for this project. Many sites have made significant progress in these areas and we have enumerated the details of their work in the following sections.</p>
                                        <p>This project is a huge undertaking, which requires coordination between different countries with different policies, and traversing multiple network domains. To improve network connections from end-to-end, summing to thousands of miles of fiber, and tens of network domains, this group will continue to work to support reliable, long-scale data transfers across the international domains. The ICNWG will continue to test and troubleshoot the network paths to each site, with ESnet’s help, for the duration of the project (up until 2016).</p>
                                        <p>The first goal for ICNWG was to achieve 500MB/sec (4Gbps) of disk-to-disk throughput during the replication of a multi-terabyte data set, using production infrastructure.  This still has to be completed between all the sites but there is sure progress that the working group sites will reach this goal within the next 6 months. In 2015, ICNWG will increase that performance by a factor of two (to 1GB/sec, 8Gbps) between nodes.  Achieving this capability on production systems will help prepare the global climate science infrastructure for the demands of CMIP6, and set the stage for continued scientific productivity in the critically-important area of climate science.  As a stretch goal, if possible, the group wishes to try for a second doubling of performance of 2GB/sec (16Gbps) between centers in 2016.</p>
